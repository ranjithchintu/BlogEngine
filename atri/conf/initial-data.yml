                    atri labs were finally under renovation,after a protractive negotiations among the 
                    director(prabhu g benkop) and our chairman(ramesh babu)
                     
                    final years response :
                    here,now its an end to the serious problem of atri college,as we felt very difficult 
                    in our previous semisters,due to lack of facilites and juniors are very lucky as they
                    are going to have a very good environment with all the facilities available to them.

                     most of the companies were ignoring our college for hiring due to lack of 
                     facilites,for example,three days ago wipro came to our college and the 
                     recruitments process was took place in class rooms,where its a shy on 
                     our management.
